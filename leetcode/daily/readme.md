üß† This folder contains **daily LeetCode challenges** I'm solving to improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  
Each day I tackle a new problem and document my approach and solution.

### Challenge List
<!-- NEW_CHALLENGES_HERE -->
### [Zero Array Transformation I](https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-i/)
- **Problem**: You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].
For each queries[i]:
Select a subset of indices within the range [li, ri] in nums.
Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.
A Zero Array is an array where all elements are equal to 0.
Return true if it is possible to transform nums into a Zero Array after processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return false.

### [Type of Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/type-of-triangle/)
- **Problem**: You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size 3 which can form the sides of a triangle.
  - A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length.
  - A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
  - A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths.
  - Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or "none" if it cannot form a triangle.

- **Approach**: The solution is structured using helper functions for clarity and modularity. First, it checks if the three sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. If they don‚Äôt, it returns `"none"`. If valid, the code checks the type of triangle by comparing side lengths:
  - If all sides are equal, it's `"equilateral"`.
  - If exactly two sides are equal, it's `"isosceles"`.
  - If all sides are different, it's `"scalene"`.

These checks are done in order of specificity, ensuring correct classification.

### [Count of Interesting Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-interesting-subarrays/)
- **Problem**: You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, an integer `modulo`, and an integer `k`.
  Your task is to find the count of subarrays that are interesting.
  A subarray `nums[l..r]` is interesting if the following condition holds:
  Let `cnt` be the number of indices `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that `nums[i] % modulo == k`. Then, `cnt % modulo == k`.
  Return an integer denoting the count of interesting subarrays.

- **Approach**: A brute-force solution would involve checking all possible subarrays, which leads to time limit exceeded on large inputs. To optimize, I use a prefix count of how many values satisfy num % modulo === k and store the counts modulo modulo in a HashMap. This allows to calculate in O(n) time how many previous prefix counts make the current one satisfy the condition using modular arithmetic and prefix sums.
