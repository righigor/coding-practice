üß† This folder contains **daily LeetCode challenges** I'm solving to improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  
Each day I tackle a new problem and document my approach and solution.

### Challenge List
<!-- NEW_CHALLENGES_HERE -->
### [Count of Interesting Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-interesting-subarrays/)
- **Problem**: You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, an integer `modulo`, and an integer `k`.
  Your task is to find the count of subarrays that are interesting.
  A subarray `nums[l..r]` is interesting if the following condition holds:
  Let `cnt` be the number of indices `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that `nums[i] % modulo == k`. Then, `cnt % modulo == k`.
  Return an integer denoting the count of interesting subarrays.

- **Approach**: A brute-force solution would involve checking all possible subarrays, which leads to time limit exceeded on large inputs. To optimize, I use a prefix count of how many values satisfy num % modulo === k and store the counts modulo modulo in a HashMap. This allows to calculate in O(n) time how many previous prefix counts make the current one satisfy the condition using modular arithmetic and prefix sums.
